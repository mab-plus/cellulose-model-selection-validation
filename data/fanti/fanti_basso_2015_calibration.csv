#
# Data extracted from Table 1 (page 4) and Table 2 (page 5)
#
# PARAMETERS:
#   sigma_R: Breaking strength [MPa]
#   E_f: Final increasing modulus [GPa]
#   E_i: Initial decreasing modulus [GPa]
#   eta_d: Loss factor (direct cycle)
#   eta_i: Loss factor (inverse cycle)
#   E_m: Mean modulus = (E_f + E_i) / 2
#   eta_m: Mean loss factor = (eta_d + eta_i) / 2
#
# NOTES:
#   - Dates are calendar years (negative = BC, positive = AD)
#   - Standard uncertainty for ln(sigma_R) and ln(E_m): 0.0577
#   - Standard uncertainty for eta_m: ~5.8% of value
